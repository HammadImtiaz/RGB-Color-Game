# RGB-Color-Game
A website built as another project in the course I'm taking on udemy.com: the Web Development Bootcamp, under instructor Colt Steele. This site lets the user play a guessing game using randomized colors on a grid of blocks. To play the game, please keep the 3 files in the same directory/folder and open the html file in your browser.
